The various brew strengths that the Magnifica ESAM 3300 can produce

I, like many others, own a DeLonghi Magnifica ESAM 3300. It's a great little machine. It's certainly the cheapest machine I've been able to find that has two boilers, a decent steam wand, and produces plenty of pressure for espresso, but without any of the frills.

HOWEVER, there is one GLARING flaw. And that's that the stupid little dosing knobs have no concrete measurements, only "more" and "less", for coffee and water.

And on top of that, I couldn't find any measurements online to fill in these gaps. So I am going to measure for each setting indicator (the little dots on the dials) the amount of (dry) coffee in, the amount of liquid out, and the ratio.

## Coffee measurements

To measure the amount of dry coffee, I weigh the grounds bin, then press the coffee button, and immediately after the coffee is tamped (before the pre-infusion starts), click the coffee button again to cancel, wait for the machine to spit the grounds into the grounds bin, and weigh it again. The difference in weight is the amount of coffee the machine intended to use. I typically take a few measurements and average them. I haven't yet bothered to report the standard deviation of these averages, though I really should.
